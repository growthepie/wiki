  On this page, you can find our different endpoints and some examples of how to
  quickly connect them to your favorite data analytics tool.

# API

Our API endpoint can be found at `https://api.growthepie.xyz/`

## Master endpoint

This endpoint contains info on all supported chains and metrics. It is mostly static meta data like chain names, important links, etc.

```
v1/master.json
```

## Contracts endpoint

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are moving all contract labeling logic to the[ Open Labels Initiative](https://www.openlabelsinitiative.org) standard. As a first step, we released [labels.growthepie.xyz](https://labels.growthepie.xyz/) and are currently working on better API endpoints. Please reach out to us via our Discord or X if you need API access to the new labels dataset - your input will be very valuable for scoping our API endpoints)
{% endhint %}

DEPRECATED (not updated anymore)! This endpoint returns all labeled contracts for all our covered chains. It includes contract address, contract name, project name, sub category key, and origin key (which is the chain)

```
v1/contracts.json
```

#### Sample Reponse

```json
[
    {
        "address": "0xEa2a41c02fA86A4901826615F9796e603C6a4491",
        "contract_name": "BridgeToBase",
        "project_name": "Base",
        "sub_category_key": "erc721",
        "origin_key": "base"
    },
    {
        "address": "0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8",
        "contract_name": "Vault",
        "project_name": "Balancer",
        "sub_category_key": "dex",
        "origin_key": "arbitrum"
    },
    ...
]
```

## Metric endpoint

These are multiple endpoints, one for each metric that we list.

```
v1/export/{METRIC}.json
```

It is currently available for the following metrics:&#x20;

* daa: Daily Active Addresses
* fdv: Fully Diluted Valuation
* fees: Fees Paid by Users
* market\_cap: Market Cap
* profit: Onchain Profit
* rent\_paid: Rent Paid to L1
* stables\_mcap: Stablecoin Market Cap&#x20;
* throughput: Throughput
* tvl: Total Value Secured&#x20;
* txcosts: Median Transaction Costs&#x20;
* txcount: Transaction Count

Example

```
https://api.growthepie.xyz/v1/export/daa.json
```

Sample Response

```json
[
 {
        "metric_key": "daa",
        "origin_key": "imx",
        "date": "2023-04-21",
        "value": 8300.0
    },
    {
        "metric_key": "daa",
        "origin_key": "imx",
        "date": "2023-04-25",
        "value": 7834.0
    },
    {
        "metric_key": "daa",
        "origin_key": "imx",
        "date": "2023-04-29",
        "value": 7558.0
    },
    ...
]
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Metrics that represent values in currencies like USD or ETH always contain 2 metric keys (i.e. tvl and tvl\_eth)
{% endhint %}

## Fundamentals endpoint

This is a very powerful endpoint for analytics and tracking. It returns all Layer 2 metrics for all chains on a daily aggregation level. The data updates daily at 5 a.m. UTC.

`v1/fundamentals_full.json`

This endpoint will grow in size and will return >10MB of data. We also created a filtered endpoint (only last 365 days and no eth values) which can be used in Google Sheets and other applications that limit the input data to 10MB.

`v1/fundamentals.json`

#### Sample Response

```json
[
    {
        "metric_key": "daa",
        "origin_key": "imx",
        "date": "2023-04-21",
        "value": 8300.0
    },
    {
        "metric_key": "txcount",
        "origin_key": "zksync_era",
        "date": "2023-02-14",
        "value": 6.0
    },
    {
        "metric_key": "daa",
        "origin_key": "imx",
        "date": "2023-04-25",
        "value": 7834.0
    },
    ...
]
```

### **Example Python**

You can quickly load data on all Layer 2s into a Pandas dataframe using the following code snippet:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://api.growthepie.xyz/v1/fundamentals_full.json'
response = requests.get(url)
df = pd.DataFrame(response.json())
```

If you want to quickly visualize the data points you can use the dataframe plot function. Here filtered down to Arbitrum and transaction count:

```python
df[(df['metric_key'] == 'txcount') & (df['origin_key'] == 'arbitrum')].sort_values('date').plot(x='date', y='value', figsize=(15, 5), title='Arbitrum Daily Transactions')
```

### Example Excel

Excel is still the most widely used tool for data analytics. Using our API, you can build this neat dashboard in less than 2 minutes:

Here is a quick guide on how to pull data from our API and visualize it

### Example PowerBI

PowerBI is a powerful BI and data visualization tool. If you want to load all Layer 2 data into a PowerBI dashboard follow these steps:

* Open a new PowerBI file
* Load data using the "Web" data connector
* Paste the API endpoint in the URL field
* Make sure the "value" column is formatted as decimal
* Load the data into your report and have fun exploring.

Here is a quick video walkthrough: [https://x.com/web3\_data/status/1697573767751548953?s=20](https://x.com/web3_data/status/1697573767751548953?s=20)

### Example Google Sheets

Sometimes it can be useful to have up-to-date Layer 2 data in Google Sheets. With our endpoint, it is very simple.

* Create app script for ImportJson function (code: [https://gist.github.com/paulgambill/cacd19da95a1421d3164](https://gist.github.com/paulgambill/cacd19da95a1421d3164))
* Paste function in cell

```
=ImportJSON("https://api.growthepie.xyz/v1/fundamentals.json")
```
